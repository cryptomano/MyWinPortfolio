# MyWinPortfolio
CryptoCurrencies Portfolio using Exchanges APIs

Screenshots : https://imgur.com/a/fhWPa

Built on C# using various libraries

- MetroFramework
- BittrexSharp
- KrakenAPISharp
- And some other I dont't remember right now, I'll update the README with proper credits when I'm less tired :) 

What's working : 

- Support Kraken, Hitbtc and Bittrex at the moment. I might add other exchanges later if there is some interest
- Retrieve your balance
- Retrieve your open orders and orders history
- Some stats

That's all for now. 

Planned : 

- More charts
- Price Alerts
- Profit Calculator for trades
- More Exchanges (Binance ?)


API Secrets are encrypted in config file. 

Only READ permission is required for API Access on all exchanges. (So program can't make orders / withdraw...). 

More help is welcome.

Sorry, I'm not a developper. Code is bad and ugly. Learning C# while doing it. Probably full of bugs. Almost no error checking. 

Donations are always welcome.
